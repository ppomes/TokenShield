# Contributing to TokenShield

We love your input! We want to make contributing to TokenShield as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/tokenshield/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/tokenshield/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Code Style
- Python: Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test with the dummy app and gateway
